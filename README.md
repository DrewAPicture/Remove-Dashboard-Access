## Installation

1. Search 'Remove Dashboard Access' from the Install Plugins screen.
2. Install plugin, click Activate.

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### What happens to disallowed users who try to login to the Dashboard?

Users lacking the chosen capability or role will be redirected to the URL set in Settings > Dashboard Access.

#### Why haven't you added an option to disable the WordPress Toolbar?

The Toolbar contains certain important links (even for disallowed users) such as for accessing to the profile editor and/or logging out. Plus, there are many plugins out there for disabling the Toolbar if you really want to.

#### Can I disable the redirection/profile-editing controls without disabling the plugin?

No. Disable the plugin if you don't wish to leverage the functionality.

## Other Notes

#### Capabilities

* You can limit Dashboard access to Admins only, Editors or above, Authors or above, or by selecting a capability. More information on WordPress' default roles and capabilities can be found here: http://codex.wordpress.org/Roles_and_Capabilities

#### User Profile Access

* You can optionally allow all users the ability to edit their profiles in the Dashboard. Users lacking the chosen capability won't be able to access any other sections of the Dashboard.

#### Login Message

* Supply a message to display on the login screen. Leaving this blank disables the message.

#### Hiding other plugins/themes' Toolbar menus

This hides some built-in WordPress Toolbar menus by default, but can be extended to hide menus from other plugins or themes via two filters: `rda_toolbar_nodes`, and `rda_frontend_toolbar_nodes`.

##### How to find the menu (node) id:

* In the HTML page source, look for the `<li>` container for the menu node you're targeting. It should take the form of `<li id="wp-admin-bar-SOMETHING">`
* In `<li id="wp-admin-bar-SOMETHING">`, you want the "SOMETHING" part.
	
##### How to filter the disallowed Toolbar nodes on the front-end:

```php
/**
 * Filter hidden Toolbar menus on the front-end.
 *
 * @param array $ids Toolbar menu IDs.
 * @return array (maybe) filtered front-end Toolbar menu IDs.
 */
function hide_some_toolbar_menu( $ids ) {
	$ids[] = 'SOMETHING';
	return $ids;
}
add_filter( 'rda_frontend_toolbar_nodes', 'hide_some_toolbar_menu' );
```

##### Common plugin Toolbar menus and their ids:

| Plugin | Menu ID |
| ------ | ------- |
| [Jetpack by WordPress.com](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/jetpack/) (notifications) | 'notes |
| [WordPress SEO by Yoast](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-seo/) | 'wpseo-menu' |
| [W3 Total Cache](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/w3-total-cache/) | 'w3tc' |
